# Memory Game
A digital version of the memory game played with cards. Uses client-side JavaScript.

All 52 cards are face down and laid out in a grid to begin. Players take turns and flip over two cards. If the face values matches (suite and colors don't matter), a point is awarded and the two cards are removed from play. The next player then flips two cards, and this goes on till all cards are paired. If the face values doesn't match, the cards are put faced down again, and the next player gets their turn.

At the end, the player with most pairs wins.

This implementaion support two players. The game with cards can be played by more than two players.

This is a game that I played with my kids recently so it was something I wanted to try to program. JavaScript/DOM programming was something new for me so I got to learn it by doing.
